# EDA-MNC_Investment
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed for a Spark fund company to understand the global trends in investments so that they can take the investment decisions effectively.

_Business Data and Understanding_: Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
1. It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
2. It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.

_Strategy_:
Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.

_Data Source_: https://www.crunchbase.com/

 _Business objective_
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.

_Goals of data analysis_: Goals are divided into three sub-goals:
1. Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
2. Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Fundsâ€™ favourites as well.
3. Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors.
